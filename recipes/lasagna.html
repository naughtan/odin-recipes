        <li>Onion</li>
        <li>Canned tomatoes</li>
        <li>Fresh herbs</li>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine pork and ground beef in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat;<br /> 
            cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Add onion and cook<br /> 
            until translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <p></p>
        <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, garlic, basil,<br />
            salt, oregano, and sugar. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring<br />
            occasionally, for 30 minutes.</li>
            <p></p>
        <li>While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.<br />
            Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet<br />
            firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and set aside.</li>
            <p></p>
        <li>While the noodles are cooking, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, remaining 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, salt,<br />
            and pepper in a large bowl until combined.</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes. Remove the foil and bake until cheese<br />
            is golden brown, 5 to 10 more minutes.</li>
            <p></p>
        <li>Remove from the oven and let stand for 10 minutes before cutting and serving</li>
    </ol>
